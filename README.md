## Overview

This is a simple journal website that lets the user record their daily reflection and add the memo to a database, which the user can pull up and view.
The user has to enter the title, pick a date, and write their memo for the day in order to add that entry into the database. Any entered entry can be 
deleted from the database if the user wants to.

## Running

Running `npm install` and `npm start` should suffice!

## Features

1. Enter a memo with title, date, and body content
2. Access the database page
3. Delete the memo from the database page
